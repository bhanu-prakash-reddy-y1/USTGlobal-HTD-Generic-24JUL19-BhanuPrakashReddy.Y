                                <p>Art galleries are in the business of aesthetics, yet it’s amazing how generic and uninventive many of their websites can be. Minimal graphics, fonts, and color schemes are designed to keep the viewer’s focus on the art itself, often at the expense of creativity and attractiveness.
                                   As in any business, it’s important for galleries to make a website that stands out and is memorable.                                  The websites on this list have achieved that goal by making subtle, yet integral
                                   design choices that, in fact, often increase both functionality and the viewing experience.</p>

                            <p>Luhring Augustine’s website may appear to have adopted the typically simplistic gallery approach, but here they show how to make a website where beauty is found in the details. They get their edge from a plethora of images, found in literally every section of the website, which create visual interest and easy navigation. Scroll your mouse over an artist’s name and a large sized image, rather than just a thumbnail, appears on the right hand side of the screen. Look up current exhibitions and find a long page dedicated to images from past and future exhibitions as well. Not a single news item is published without some sort of photo attached, so that the palette of grey in the web 
                              page background design becomes simply a canvas upon which a library of images is projected.</p>
